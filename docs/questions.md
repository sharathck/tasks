How many days will it take the snail to reach the top of the well?", "Answer": "28 days. (On the 27th day, it reaches 27 feet. On the 28th day, it climbs the remaining 3 feet and reaches the top before it can slip back down.)" }, { "Question": "You have a balance scale and 9 coins. One coin is slightly heavier than the others, but you can't tell which one just by looking. What is the minimum number of weighings needed to guarantee you find the heavier coin?", "Answer": "2 weighings. (Divide the coins into three groups of three. Weigh two groups. If they balance, the heavier coin is in the third group. If they don't, the heavier coin is on the heavier side. Then, take the heavier group of three and weigh two of those coins. If they balance, the third coin is heavier. If they don't, the heavier coin is on the heavier side.)" }, { "Question": "Imagine you're driving a bus. At the first stop, 5 people get on. At the second stop, 3 people get off and 2 get on. At the third stop, 4 people get off and 1 gets on. What color are the bus driver's eyes?", "Answer": "The answer depends on the person answering the question, as the question asks for the color of *your* eyes (since you are imagining you are the bus driver)." }, { "Question": "A farmer has a fox, a goose, and a bag of beans. He needs to cross a river, but his boat can only carry him and one other item at a time. He can't leave the fox alone with the goose (the fox will eat the goose), and he can't leave the goose alone with the beans (the goose will eat the beans). How can he get everything across the river safely?", "Answer": "1. Take the goose across. 2. Return alone. 3. Take the fox across. 4. Bring the goose back. 5. Take the beans across. 6. Return alone. 7. Take the goose across." }, { "Question": "If you have a pizza and you cut it into 8 equal slices, what is the minimum number of straight cuts you need to make?", "Answer": "3 cuts. (One cut down the middle, another perpendicular to it, and a third across the center.)" }, { "Question": "Two trains are 100 miles apart and traveling towards each other on the same track. Train A is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and Train B is traveling at 40 miles per hour. How far apart are the trains one hour before they collide?", "Answer": "100 miles. (Combined speed is 100 mph, so one hour before they meet, they will be 100 miles apart)" }, { "Question": "You have two ropes that each take exactly one hour to burn completely. The ropes do not burn at a constant rate. How can you use these ropes to measure exactly 45 minutes?", "Answer": "Light both ends of rope A and one end of rope B simultaneously. When rope A burns out (after 30 minutes), light the other end of rope B. Rope B will now burn out in 15 minutes. Total time: 30 + 15 = 45 minutes." }, { "Question": "A lily pad doubles in size every day. If it takes 48 days for the lily pad to cover the entire pond, how long does it take for the lily pad to cover half of the pond?", "Answer": "47 days. (Since it doubles in size each day, it was half the size of the pond the day before it covered the entire pond.)" }, { "Question": "What is special about the number 8,549,176,320?", "Answer": "It contains all the digits in alphabetical order (eight, five, four, nine, one, seven, six, three, two, zero)." }, { "Question": "If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?", "Answer": "5 minutes. (Each machine makes one widget in 5 minutes, so 100 machines would make 100 widgets in 5 minutes.)" }, { "Question": "You are in a room with three light switches. Each switch controls one of three light bulbs in the next room. You can only enter the next room once. How can you figure out which switch controls which bulb?", "Answer": "1. Flip switch #1 and leave it on for a few minutes. 2. Turn switch #1 off and flip switch #2 on. 3. Enter the room. The lit bulb is connected to switch #2. Touch the other two bulbs. The warm bulb is connected to switch #1, and the cold bulb is connected to switch #3." }, { "Question": "A man is walking down the street when it starts to rain.
